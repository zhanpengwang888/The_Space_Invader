# The_Space_Invader
This is a game designed by me using Processing software with Java. The player use arrow keys to controls the defender spaceship and clicks space key to destroy the invading aliens.

This game still needs a lot of improvements.

Here are something I can work on:

Build a nice User interface. 
Probably create a simple AI defender?
Fix the restart button.
Increase the difficulty?
Making the shelter blocks moving?
